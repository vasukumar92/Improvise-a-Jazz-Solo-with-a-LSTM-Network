# Improvise-a-Jazz-Solo-with-a-LSTM-Network
You would like to create a jazz music piece specially for a friend's birthday. However, you don't know any instruments or music composition. Fortunately, you know deep learning and will solve this problem using an LSTM netwok.  You will train a network to generate novel jazz solos in a style representative of a body of performed work. Process Flow:  Apply an LSTM to music generation. Generating jazz music with deep learning.
